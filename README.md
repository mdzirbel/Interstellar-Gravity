# Interstellar-Gravity
Gravity Simulator game, one of my first programming and Python projects

Place planets and other bodies by clicking in the top left bar to select, then clicking in the center to place them.
You can give planets initial velocities by clicking and dragging.
Planets move based off of gravity from the other bodies, and are the only thing that move.
The other bodies have different effects, explore them to find out what they do!
You can adjust some game settings on the right, as well as the menu, and clearing the bodies.
